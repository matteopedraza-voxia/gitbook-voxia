### Campaign Setup

1. **Campaign Type**: Select whether the campaign is Outbound or Inbound.
2. **Agent Name**: Enter a name for the agent. This name will be used by the agent for identification during calls.
3. **Use Case**: Describe the general script, purpose of the call, or topics to be covered during the call. Including company information can enhance the accuracy of the generated script, making it more tailored and effective for your specific needs.

### Starting Your Campaign

* **Start from Scratch**: If you prefer to manually create your campaign script from the very beginning, close the Generate Script window and start adding new steps.
* **Generate Campaign**: After filling in the necessary details:
  * Click the **Generate** button.
  * Wait for the campaign generation to complete. During this time, you can edit scenarios or set up your campaign using the top navigation bar.
