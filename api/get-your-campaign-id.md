# Get Your Campaign ID

This guide will help you easily find the ID for a specific campaign within your account. Follow these steps to locate your campaign ID:

* Log in to your account and navigate to the specific campaign for which you need the Id.
* Once you're in the campaign, look at the URL in your web browser's address bar. The URL will follow this format:

```http
https://app.voxia.ai/campaigns/{campaignId}
```

The section marked `{campaignId}` is your unique campaign ID.

* You can use this campaign ID as required for API calls, and other integrations where a campaign identifier is necessary.
